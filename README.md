## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
To create an isolated environment for project dependencies, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Dependency Installation

There are two methods for installing dependencies:

1. While the conventional approach is to use `pip install -r requirements.txt`, I recommend running the script and installing each missing module as indicated by the error messages, until the script executes successfully.

2. Alternatively, you can directly install all dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Exiting the Virtual Environment
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
